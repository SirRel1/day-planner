This is my 'Day Planner'! The user is able to save plans according to the day and the hour. When the time has passed the corresponding hour block gets filled in "blue".

The user is able to save plans and set them in local storage and retrieve data even after leaving the page. If the user wants they can clear the events and the storage with button clicks.

Sn: It can use refatoring for looping through hours and comparing them to current hour! Thinking through this challenge!...
